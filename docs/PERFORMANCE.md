# Performance work (result-neutral)

Goal: make `fastroute` faster **without changing any result**. Every step below keeps the SES
output byte-identical to the Java parity build (`fastroute --parity`) and keeps the parallel
optimizer mode deterministic and identical to its previous output.

## Methodology

* Machine: M-series Mac, 10 cores. Release build (`lto = "thin"`, `codegen-units = 1`).
* Profiling: `samply record --save-only --unstable-presymbolicate -o prof.json.gz -- <cmd>`,
  then `python3 scripts/prof-top.py prof.json.gz 40` (self + inclusive).
* Timings in the step log: single runs, wall clock (`/usr/bin/time`), machine otherwise idle
  unless noted; per-step numbers are indicative (±2 %). The final table is a serial run of all
  configurations with the pre-change binary and the final binary back to back.
* Parity gate after every step:
  * `cargo test --release --workspace` (includes `crates/fastroute/tests/pipeline_parity.rs`
    and the Java replay vector tests);
  * full pipeline `--parity` on bm02, bm06, bm07, bm08, bm09, bm11, pic_programmer, ecc83-pp,
    sonde xilinx, interf_u against `reference/parity-baseline/<board>.ses`;
  * autorouter only (`--router.optimizer.enabled=false`) on CM5_MINIMA_3 (`-mp 3`) and bm04
    against the pre-change binary, which was verified to be identical to the Java parity build
    for exactly these flags;
  * parallel optimizer (`--optimizer-mode=parallel --router.optimizer.max_threads=1` and `=8`)
    on bm11 and pic_programmer: 1 and 8 threads identical, and identical to the pre-change
    output;
  * the final binary additionally reproduces `reference/parity-baseline` on all 20 boards.
* `FASTROUTE_VERIFY_CACHES=1` (new): every memoized / indexed result is recomputed the old way
  and compared (contacts cache, per-net incomplete counts, indexed overlap queries against the
  Java traversal, leaf masks against the current shape layers). The whole gate passes in this
  mode.

## Optimizations (in the order applied)

| # | Change | Where | Measured effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Simplex` intersection tests without building the intersection: sort line *indices* with the ported TimSort and run the (unchanged) redundant-line algorithm on stack buffers; no `Line` clones (each clone went through `OnceLock` initialization) | `fr-geom/simplex.rs` (`redundant_lines_core`, `intersection_nonempty`), `java_sort::sort_indices_by` | CM5 AR `-mp 3`: 30.7 s → 25.1 s |
| 2 | Canonical sort of `overlaps` results by a precomputed `u64` key (kind, descending id, shape index) with `sort_unstable`; falls back to the comparator sort in traversal order if ids span ≥ 2^31, a shape index is negative or keys are not unique | `search_tree.rs` `sort_leaves_canonical` | CM5: 25.1 → 22.7 s |
| 3 | Memoized normal contacts: per-thread cache keyed by content epochs of the item repository and the default tree's item entries (epochs are process-wide unique numbers renewed by every `&mut` access, so clones share them only while their content is equal) | `board/epoch.rs`, `connectivity.rs`, `item_list.rs`, `search_tree.rs` | CM5: 22.7 → 13.7 s (fanout 18.9 s → 1.8 s) |
| 4 | Secondary spatial index for the sorted `overlaps` queries: hierarchical uniform grid over the leaf x/y ranges (flat arrays, cheap to clone), maintained on leaf insert/remove; the exact same leaf test is applied | `datastructures/leaf_grid.rs`, `MinAreaTree::overlapping_leaves_indexed` | CM5: 13.7 → 13.4 s, interf_u AR 8.9 → 8.2 s, bm04 AR 43.5 → 41.5 s |
| 5 | Layer masks in the search tree: each leaf carries the bit of its shape layer, inner nodes the union; queries that drop other layers (overlap queries with `layer >= 0`, the three `completeShape` variants) skip subtrees without leaves on that layer. The 45/90 degree `completeShape` walks see exactly the same sequence of relevant leaves (skipped leaves are ignored by the loop and never change the query) | `min_area_tree.rs` (`mask`, `next_leaf_masked`), `search_tree.rs`, `complete_shape.rs` | CM5: 13.4 → 10.5 s (only 7–17 % of the leaves visited by `completeShape` are on the room layer) |
| 6 | Shove checks compute only the needed tree shape of a substitute trace instead of all of them per index (was O(n²)); `IntOctagon::to_simplex` without the intermediate simplex, plus a small per-thread memo (Java memorizes it in the octagon) | `trace_shover.rs`, `int_octagon.rs` | bm04 AR: ~33 → 27.8 s |
| 7 | `Line` direction cache in atomics instead of `OnceLock` (cheap init and clone) | `fr-geom/line.rs` | ~1 %, removes `Once::call` (3–5 %) from profiles |
| 8 | One grid per layer (`LayeredGrid`) | `leaf_grid.rs` | bm04 `-mp 3`: 10.35 → 9.80 s user, CM5 `-mp 3`: 9.64 → 9.21 s |
| 9 | Compact structure-of-arrays copy of the node data for the traversals, specialized box/octagon tests (trees are homogeneous) | `min_area_tree.rs` (`HotNode`, `walk`) | ~1 % |
| 10 | mimalloc as global allocator of the CLI (**note:** the `#[global_allocator]` line was lost before the round-1 commit, so the round-1 results below were measured with the system allocator; restored in round 2, step R2.1) | `fastroute` | interf_u full: 17.3 → 15.7 s, bm04 full: 25.5 → 24.1 s |
| 11 | Per-net memo of the incomplete counts used by the pipeline (`calculateIncompleteCount`, called before and after every optimizer candidate), keyed by the keys and content versions of the net's items | `pipeline/stats.rs`, `item_list.rs` (`version`) | `NetIncompletes` 8.5 % → 4 % of bm11 full; ~1.5 % wall |
| 12 | `Simplex ∩ IntOctagon` uses the memoized octagon simplex; small per-thread memo for `Simplex::enlarge` (keyed by line-array identity, the memo holds the `Arc`) | `simplex.rs` | ~2 % |

Tried and rejected / not done:
* Single uniform grid with a "big leaves" list: slower than the tree (planes decompose into
  many large tiles) → replaced by the hierarchical grid.
* Replacing the maze `TreeSet` by a heap: the tie-break of the Java comparator uses door ids
  that change while elements are queued (incomplete rooms become complete), so the Java tree
  order cannot be reproduced by a heap.
* Memoizing shove / forced-via checks: they call count-mode `TimeLimit`s, whose call counts
  decide results in parity mode.

## Results (round 1)

Serial runs, pre-change binary vs final binary (wall clock seconds, peak RSS). `full` =
`fastroute --parity` (fanout, autorouter, java-compat optimizer); `ar` = autorouter only
(`--router.optimizer.enabled=false`, CM5 with `-mp 3`); `parN` = `--parity
--optimizer-mode=parallel --router.optimizer.max_threads=N`. Java parity = the Java parity build
(`reference/parity-baseline/summary.tsv`, same machine, JVM start-up included). All 20 full
runs reproduce `reference/parity-baseline/<board>.ses` byte for byte; the `ar`/`par` runs are
identical to the pre-change binary (and `par1` == `par8`).

Peak RSS grows by 10–30 % on most boards and by 57 % on CM5_MINIMA_3 (mimalloc, the grid index,
the compact node copy, the per-thread caches); bm04 uses less.


## Round 2

Same rules and gate as round 1 (plus parallel mode checked with 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 threads).
Per-step effect measured as user seconds of four runs: bm05 full / interf_u full / CM5
autorouter `-mp 3` / bm04 autorouter (all byte-identical to their references).

| # | Change | Where | Measured effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| R2.1 | Restored the mimalloc `#[global_allocator]` (lost in round 1) | `fastroute/src/main.rs` | bm05 full 15.22 → 13.78 s, interf_u full 17.15 → 15.91 s (wall) |
| R2.2 | Intersection of two simplices: the two line arrays are already sorted, so Java's TimSort of the concatenation equals the stable merge of the two runs whenever `Line.compareTo` is exact and consistent (non-zero directions with components < 2^26: the `f64` determinant is exact, the comparator is the angle order). Checked per call, otherwise TimSort; unit test against TimSort | `fr-geom/simplex.rs` (`merge_sorted_runs`) | 13.57/15.30/8.49/23.45 → 13.26/15.11/8.25/22.79 |
| R2.3 | Cloning a `MinAreaTree` no longer copies the grid index (rebuilt lazily; board snapshots and deep copies are rarely queried) | `min_area_tree.rs` | CM5 full peak RSS 361 → 325 MB |
| R2.4 | Parallel optimizer: candidates are claimed in order by the workers (shared counter) and results consumed strictly in candidate order as soon as available, instead of fixed chunks with a barrier; nothing after the stop point is consumed, so the result is unchanged for any thread count | `pipeline/optimizer.rs` (`stream_parallel`, `PassConsumer`) | 8 threads: interf_u 9.74 → 7.93 s, bm06 2.89 → 1.65 s, bm11 1.50 → 1.46 s (wall) |
| R2.5 | 45-degree `completeShape`/`restrainShape` on plain `(IntOctagon, IntOctagon)` pairs with two reused buffers (no `TileShape`/`Vec` per obstacle and room); the bounding union only adds the new rooms (the component-wise union is idempotent) | `complete_shape.rs` | 13.26/15.18/8.26/22.76 → 12.99/14.68/8.11/22.57 |
| R2.6 | Redundant-line removal reads each line's int direction once into a stack array | `simplex.rs` | → 12.89/14.65/8.05/22.39 |
| R2.7 | `Simplex::get_instance` on index arrays (clones only the kept lines); octagon→simplex memo slot hash fixed (used only 256 of its slots) and enlarged to 1024 | `simplex.rs`, `int_octagon.rs` | → 12.70/14.46/7.99/22.02 |
| R2.8 | Grid: skip levels without leaves | `leaf_grid.rs` | → 12.63/14.40/7.99/21.95 |
| R2.9 | Profile-guided optimization: `scripts/build-pgo.sh` (instrumented build, training on bm06, bm11 java-compat + parallel, interf_u / CM5 / multichannel_mixer autorouter, `llvm-profdata merge`, optimized build in `target/pgo/use`); `--native` adds `-C target-cpu=native` (measured: no further gain on M-series) | `scripts/build-pgo.sh` | 12.80/14.54/8.03/22.03 → 10.46/12.46/7.06/18.39 (−13…−18 %) |

Tried without measurable gain (reverted / not applied): grid cell density and level span
tuning (±1 % across 5 settings), computing the maze key's door id once per `TreeSet` insertion,
mimalloc purge / eager-commit options (RSS unchanged). Optimizer-specific overheads outside
routing (incomplete counts, deep copies, statistics) are now ≈ 2–3 % of a candidate; bm01's
time is routing (pass 2 with increased ripup costs takes 4× pass 1).

The 45-degree `completeShape` walk must stay order-exact; its per-node test is already the
compact form. A result-neutral alternative exists in principle (the query only shrinks, so the
walk equals a scan of the leaves in fixed traversal order), but it needs the traversal rank of
leaves in a tree that changes between calls, which costs more than the walk saves.

### Results (round 2)

Serial runs (wall clock seconds). `round 1` = commit 6044d65 as built (system allocator, see
R2.1); `round 2` = this round, normal release build; `+ PGO` = `scripts/build-pgo.sh`. All
`full` runs reproduce `reference/parity-baseline/<board>.ses`; `ar`/`par` runs are identical to
the pre-round-1 binary, `par1` == `par8`. Java parity from `reference/parity-baseline/summary.tsv`.

Memory: the full and autorouter runs use less memory than in round 1 (CM5 539 → 309 MB,
bm04 342 → 201 MB, multichannel_mixer 540 → 120 MB). The 8-thread parallel runs use more
(interf_u 345 → 535 MB): mimalloc keeps per-thread heaps for the 8 concurrent board clones
(chunked evaluation with mimalloc: 516 MB, so it is the allocator, not the streaming).

## Next ideas

* 45-degree `completeShape` tree walk (~9 % self) and grid scans (~6 %) remain the largest
  single items; everything else is ≤ 5 %.
* Maze `TreeSet`: door ids are recomputed through room lookups on every comparison; caching
  them needs invalidation whenever a room is completed.
* Parallel mode: cap mimalloc's per-thread retention (e.g. `mi_collect` after each candidate)
  if memory matters more than ~2 % speed.
* Make PGO the default release pipeline (CI step running `scripts/build-pgo.sh`).
